### About this Application

This is a simple demonstration of a shiny app using the "cars" dataset in R. Use the slider bars to explore mean squared errors for different values of speed and distance.   

According to R, "The data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s."
